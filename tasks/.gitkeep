# Tasks Directory

This directory contains the daily programming tasks and solutions.

## Structure

Each day's task is stored in a folder named by date:

```
tasks/
└── YYYY-MM-DD/
    ├── problem.md         # Problem description
    ├── solution-step-1.ts # First step
    ├── solution-step-2.ts # Second step
    ├── ...
    ├── solution-final.ts  # Complete solution
    └── solution.test.ts   # Test file
```

## Note

This directory is automatically populated by the daily automation.
Old tasks are archived monthly to `/archive/YYYY-MM/`.
